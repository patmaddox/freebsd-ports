Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.

Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable and
descriptive file-naming scheme. The file name must offer a clear
indication of what the contents are about, without reference to any
other metadata. Denote basically streamlines the creation of such
files or file names while providing facilities to link between them
(where those files are editable).

Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes". It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos. Naming files in a consistent way makes their filtering
and retrieval considerably easier. Denote provides relevant facilities
to rename files, regardless of file type.

Denote is based on the following core design principles:

- predictability
- composability
- portability
- flexibility
- hackability

ob-go enables Org-Babel support for evaluating go code. It was created
based on the usage of ob-C. The go code is compiled and run via the go
run command. If a main function isn't present, by default the code is
wrapped in a simple main func. If :package option isn't set and no
package is declared in the code, then the main package is declared.
